Basic definitions and operations with vectors in the plane are described:
multiplication of a vector by a number, addition and subtraction.
Examples from physics are given.

It is shown how to find the length of vectors when vectors are added.

Ð¡ases for finding the length of the sum of vectors are considered,
depending on the angle at which the vectors are directed to each other.

The concept of the coordinates and componets of a vector are given,
and how to find them in different cases.

The scalar product and vector product are not included
in the arcticle.
